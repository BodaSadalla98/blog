    "## Decoupled Neural Interfaces using Synthetic Gradients\n",
    "\n",
    "* In NN, the training process, has 3 bottle-necks\n",
    "    - forward lock: you need to calculate teh output of the previous layer before you can can go into next layer in forward pass\n",
    "    - backward pass: the same, but for backward propagation \n",
    "    - weights lock: you can't update weights unless you do for weights in next layer\n",
    "* the paper trying to unlock these bootle-necks by decoupling each layer, to be sufficient alone\n",
    "* it does that by introducing, a Synthetic Gradient Model, that can predict the gradient for the current layer, without waiting for the gradient of the next layer\n",
    "* this was we can calculate gradient and update weights as soon as we calculate the activation of the current layer\n",
    "\n",
    "### Synthetic Gradient Model\n",
    "* can be just a simple NN that is trained to output the gradient of the layer\n",
    "* it can be trained using the true gradient, or even the synthetic gradient of the next layer\n",
    "* it's important that the last layer computes the true gradient, as in the end we must have a ground truth to can calculate a true loss, and the NN would actually train\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* we can have also synthetic model for forward pass, that works with the same idea"

    "* We are in the Era of  Big Models\n",
    "* Model generalization is hard, models trained on certain data domain, doesn't scare to other\n",
    "* Datasets creation, and high research tasks, made it hard for small companies to train task-specific models\n",

    "* data duplication \n",
    "* data has to cover all domains\n",
    "* low quality data\n",
    "* hard to create huge datasets\n",

    "### Knowledge \n",
    "* a new way to represent data\n",
    "* we represent knowledge as knowledge graphs\n",
    "* KG consists of: Instances, Relation, Concept, and Values\n",
    "* KG can be created using : experts, wiki-based knowledge graphs, or extracted from unstructured texts\n",
    "#### KG Completion and Integration\n",
    "* most of the known KGs has many fields empty, and there's a going research in how to deal with that and fill the gaps.\n",
    "* some methods try to do that using intra-graph knowledge augmentation or with inter-graph.\n",
