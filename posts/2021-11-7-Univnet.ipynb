    "The WaveGAN architecture is based off DCGAN. The DCGAN generator uses the transposed convolution operation to iteratively upsample low-resolution feature maps into a high-resolution image. WaveGAN modifies this transposed convolution operation to widen its receptive field, using a longer one-dimensional filters of length 25 instead of two-dimensional filters of size 5x5, and upsampling by a factor of 4 instead of 2 at each layer. The discriminator is modified in a similar way, using length-25 filters in one dimension and increasing stride from 2 to 4. These changes result in WaveGAN having the same number of parameters, numerical operations, and output dimensionality as DCGAN\n",

    "Parallel WaveGAN1, a distillation-free, fast, and small-footprint waveform generation method using a generative adversarial network. In the proposed method, a non-autoregressive WaveNet is trained by jointly optimizing multi-resolution spectrogram and adversarial loss functions, which can effectively capture the time-frequency distribution of the realistic speech waveform. As our method does not require density distillation used in the conventional teacher-student framework, the entire model can be easily trained even with a small number of parameters. In particular, the proposed Parallel WaveGAN has only 1.44 M parameters and can generate 24 kHz speech waveform 28.68 times faster than real-time on a single GPU environment. Perceptual listening test results verify that our proposed method achieves 4.16 mean opinion score within a Transformer-based text-to-speech framework, which is comparative to the best distillation-based Parallel WaveNet system.\n",
